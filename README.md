EnvironmentWash
===============

Team project for SWEN-444 User Centered Requirements and Design.

Environment Wash is a web application that addresses the needs of citizens who
are concerned about environmental issues. The solution that Environment Wash
will attempt to achieve is to raise awareness and encourage active volunteerism
for environmental projects in a personâ€™s local community. Environment Wash will
achieve this by providing an online space where concerned citizens can create,
organize and discover environmental projects in their local communities.
